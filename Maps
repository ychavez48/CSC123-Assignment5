A map data structure is just a collection of unique keys and values where each has a specific value. 
The map and SortedMap has three classes. They are known as HashMap, TreeMap, and Linked HashMap. 
HashMap is it class that allows operations like inserting, deleting and locating certain elements in a map.
A few methods available in HashMap include enumeration keys() (which fetches the keys), Boolean contains key(object key)
(checks whether a key is present in a HashMap) or object remove(object key) (which passes a key but removes the object. 
TreeMap on the other hand stores the key value and pairs and sorted order which allows faster retrieval. 
Unlike HashMap, TreeMap allows the user to have access to the elements in ascending order. Some methods in TreeMap 
include Boolean containsKey(object key) (which refers to returning true or false if the map contains a mapping 
for specific key) , set entrySet() (which refers to returning a set of view of mappings contained in the map) or
SortedMap headMap(object key) (which refers to returning the view of the portion of the map which keys are strictly less).
Finally, LinkedHashSet refers to a class in Java that has collections of frameworks which allow the functionalities
of both the hash table and the linked list data structures. In other words, this class defines the order in which the 
elements are inserted into the hash tables. Map data structures in other words is an easier or more organized way of 
doing an array. A few methods would also be included under map would be containsValue(object) (which returns a Boolean 
If a specified value is mapped), Equals(object) (which returns the value mapped with a specified key or also let user
know if the key is not mapped) or size() (which simply lets the user know the total number of keys and value pairs in a map).
